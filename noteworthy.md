# Noteworthy Foam Resources

This list of resources contains noteworthy items that should be considered but might not be the most polished or robust of resources.

- [Foam Lite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=theowenyoung.foam-lite-vscode): Fork of Foam with only wikilink complete and new note creation features enabled
- [Foam Similarity Plugin](https://github.com/MalcolmMielle/foam_plugins): seems to be an experimental repo that determines similar documents within Foam using tf-idf methods
- [scripture-study extension](https://github.com/johndturn/scripture-study): seemingly abandoned project with the idea of creating templates for scripture study session in Foam

## Seemingly Abandoned

These are projects that I am hoping are just in development by very busy people so I am keeping the links around as a reminder.
